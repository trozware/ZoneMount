## Zone Mount

#### Add-on for World of Warcraft

**Zone Mount** provides a way to summon a suitable mount, preferably one from the zone or region you are in.

You may have collected a lot of mounts, but if you never remember to use them, you are missing out on some fun content. Maybe you always use a mount from among the same few, or maybe a mount just doesn't fit in with where you are.

**Zone Mount** checks all your mounts and tries to summon a mount that is native to your current zone. If you have no mounts or only a few mounts from the zone, you may see a random mount instead.

If you want to summon a particular mount, **Zone Mount** can search your mounts for a mount matching the name you enter.

### Usage

Use the Slash Commands listed below to operate **Zone Mount** or enter `/zm` in the Chat window to see a list of these commands.

Type `/zm macro` in the Chat to create a macro and stick its button to your mouse so you can place it into your action bar. This is the best way to use **Zone Mount**. The macro button will mount or dismount, but unlike Blizzard's "Summon Favorite Mount" button, it will not dismount you from a flying mount when you are hundreds of feet in the air! If it is not possible to mount at a particular time, the Chat will show you the reason for this.

If you really do want to plummet out of the sky, click the macro button twice inside 2 seconds.

Read the mount's name and description in the Chat. These descriptions can be very funny - yet another way we are missing out on some good content.

Use Game Menu > Options > AddOns > ZoneMount to set whether and how often you want the mount info to appear in the chat and to make **Zone Mount** choose from your favorite mounts only.

By default, dragonriding mounts will be called in Dragon Isles but not outside them. Hold down a modifier key (Shift, Ctrl or Alt) while clicking the macro button to call the other type. You can change the default behavior in Game Menu > Options > AddOns > ZoneMount.

### Slash Commands

- /zm mount - mount or dismount.
- /zm about - show info about your current mount.
- /zm <name> - search for a mount by name (searching is case-insensitive and will find partial matches).
- /zm macro - create a macro for easy use of Zone Mount.
- /zm do - make your mount do its special action if it is on the ground.

**Zone Mount** is a companion add-on to **ZonePet** which you can also get from [CurseForge](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/zonepet). While the two add-ons are similar, they are completely independent so you do not have to install both (although I hope you will).
